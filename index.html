        <h2>MS Dhoni</h2>
        <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni (/məˈheɪndrə ˈsɪŋ dhæˈnɪ/ i; born 7 July 1981) is a former Indian cricketer who played as a wicket-keeper-batsman. Considered to be one of the greatest players of his generation, he is known for his explosive batting, wicket-keeping and leadership skills. He was the captain of the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. He currently plays for and captains Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League.

Dhoni's performance in the 2002–03 season included three half-centuries in the Ranji Trophy and a couple of half-centuries in the Deodhar Trophy, as he started gaining recognition for his lower-order contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style.
            
            Dhoni made his ODI debut on 23 December 2004, against Bangladesh in Chittagong,[7] and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka.[8] He played his first T20I also a year later against South Africa.[9] In 2007, he took over the ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid and he also selected as T20I captain of India in this year.[10] In 2008, he was selected as Test captain.[11] His captaincy record in Tests format was mixed, successfully leading India to a series win against New Zealand in 2008 and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (home series in 2010 and 2013) against Australia.[12] In other formats, Dhoni is the first cricketer to be a winning captain of all three major ICC trophies, as under his captaincy, India won the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2011 Cricket World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, the most by any captain. He also led India to victory in the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cup. Additionally, under his leadership, India won the 2010 and 2011 ICC Test Mace and 2013 ICC ODI Championship. He has scored 17,266 runs in International Cricket (including 10,000 plus runs in ODI Internationals).
            
            He is the captain of Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the Indian Premier League, leading them to the final on 10 occasions and winning in the 2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and 2023 editions of the league, as well as winning the Champions League T20 two times, in 2010 and 2014. He is the 7th cricketer have scored more than 5,000 runs in the IPL, as well as being the first wicket-keeper to do so.
            
            Dhoni received India's highest sports honour, the Major Dhyanchand Khel Ratna Award in 2008 for his outstanding achievements and the Government of India honoured him India's fourth civilian award Padma Shri in 2009 and third civilian award Padma Bhushan in 2018. He is the only cricket captain in the world to win all three of the Cricket World Cup, ICC Men's T20 World Cup and ICC Champions Trophy. Dhoni holds an honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Parachute Regiment of the Indian Territorial Army,[13] it was presented to him by the Indian Army in 2011 for his service to the nation as a cricketer.[14] Dhoni is considered one of the most popular cricketers in the world.[15] He is a leading brand endorser celebrity in India. The 2016 film, M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story was made as a biopic on his life.
            
            He announced his retirement from Tests on 30 December 2014,[16] and stepped down as captain of T20Is and ODIs in 2017. On 15 August 2020, Dhoni retired from all formats of international cricket and continues to play in the IPL.[17][18]</p>

        <h2>Early life and background</h2>
        <p>Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails from a Hindu Rajput family to parents from Uttarakhand.[2][3] He is the youngest of three children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi.[19][20][21][4] His paternal village Lwali, is in Jainti Tehsil, Lamgara block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand.[22] His parents moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi, Jharkhand where his father worked as a pump operator in junior management position in MECON Colony situated in Doranda area in Ranchi.[23] Unlike Dhoni, his uncle and cousins spell their surname "Dhauni".[22]

            Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir school's football team,[24] but after seeing his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, one who inspired Dhoni to be a cricketer, picked him to play cricket for his school team.[25] His exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to become the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club (1995–1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where he performed well.[4]
            
            From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway station under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal.[5][6]</p>
         <hr>   
         <h2>Early career</h2>
         <h3>Junior cricket in Bihar</h3>
         <p>In 1998, Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay, a former Bihar Cricket Association Vice President and Ranchi District Cricket President, to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team.[26] Till 1998 Dhoni, who was in 12th grade, had never played professional cricket. At CCL, he got an opportunity to bat higher up the order, where he performed exceptionally, which had helped CCL move to the A division.[27] Deval Sahay, impressed by his performance, pushed for his selection in the Bihar team.[28] Dhoni moved to the Ranchi team, the junior Bihar cricket team and eventually the senior Bihar Ranji Team within one year.[29][30]</p>
         
         <p>In the 1998–99 Cooch Behar Trophy, Dhoni played for the U-19 Bihar team and scored 176 runs in 5 matches (7 innings). However, Bihar finished fourth in the group of six and did not make it to the quarter-finals. Dhoni was not picked for the East Zone U-19 squad (CK Nayudu Trophy) or Rest of India squad (MA Chidambaram Trophy and Vinoo Mankad Trophy). In the 1999–2000 Cooch Behar Trophy, the Bihar U-19 cricket team made it to the finals, where Dhoni's 84 helped Bihar post a total of 357.[31] Nevertheless, Bihar's efforts were thwarted by Punjab's 839 with Dhoni's future teammate Yuvraj Singh making 358.[32][33] Dhoni's contribution in the tournament included 488 runs (9 matches, 12 innings), 5 fifties, 17 catches and 7 stumpings.[34] Dhoni made it to the East Zone U-19 squad for the CK Nayudu trophy in the 1999–2000 season but scored only 97 runs in four matches, as East Zone lost all four matches and finished last in the tournament.[35][36][37]</p>
            <h2>Bihar cricket team</h2>
            <p>Dhoni made his Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar in the 1999–2000 season, as an eighteen-year-old. He made a half century in his debut match scoring 68* in the second innings against Assam cricket team.[38] Dhoni finished the season with 283 runs in 5 matches. Dhoni scored his maiden first-class century while playing for Bihar against Bengal in the 2000/01 season.[39] Apart from this century, his performance in the 2000/01 season[40] did not include another score over fifty and in the 2001/02 season, he scored just five fifties in four Ranji matches.[41]</p>
<h2>Jharkhand cricket team</h2>
<p>Dhoni's performance in the 2002–03 season included three half-centuries in the Ranji Trophy and a couple of half-centuries in the Deodhar Trophy, as he started gaining recognition for his lower-order contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style. In the 2003/04 season, Dhoni scored a century (128*) against Assam in the first match of the Ranji ODI tournament. Dhoni was part of the East Zone squad that won the Deodhar Trophy 2003–2004 season[42][43] and contributed with 244 runs in 4 matches,[44] including a century (114) against Central zone.[45]</p>
<p>In the Duleep Trophy finals, Dhoni was picked over international cricketer Deep Dasgupta to represent East Zone.[46] He scored a fighting half-century in the second innings in a losing cause.[47] Dhoni's talent was discovered via the BCCI's small-town talent-spotting initiative TRDW. Dhoni was discovered by TRDO[48] Prakash Poddar, captain of Bengal in the 1960s, when he saw Dhoni play for Jharkhand at a match in Jamshedpur in 2003, and sent a report to the National Cricket Academy.[49]
    <h2>India A team</h2>
    <p>He was recognised for his efforts in the 2003/04 season, especially in the One Day format and was picked for the India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya.[50] Against the Zimbabwe XI in Harare Sports Club, Dhoni had his best wicket-keeping effort with 7 catches and 4 stumpings in the match.[51] In the tri-nation tournament involving Kenya, India A and Pakistan A, Dhoni helped India A chase down their target of 223 against Pakistan A with a half-century.[52] Continuing his good performance, he scored back to back centuries – 120[53] and 119*[54] – against the same team. Dhoni scored 362 runs in 6 innings at an average of 72.40 and his performance in the series received attention from the then Indian captain – Sourav Ganguly[55] and Ravi Shastri, amongst others.</p>

<h2>International career</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Start of ODI career</h3>
<p>The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent.[55] The team also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks, with talents like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads.[55] With Dhoni making a mark in the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05.[56] Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut.[57] In spite of an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI series.[58]</p>
<h3>Breakthrough</h3>
<p>In the second match of the series, Dhoni, in his fifth one-day international, scored 148 in Visakhapatnam off only 123 deliveries. Dhoni's 148 surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper,[59] a record that he would re-write before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Dhoni had few batting opportunities in the first two games of the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series (October–November 2005) and was promoted to No. 3 in the third ODI at Sawai Mansingh Stadium (Jaipur). Sri Lanka had set India a target of 299 after a Kumar Sangakkara century and, in reply, India lost Tendulkar early. Dhoni was promoted to accelerate the scoring and ended the game with an unbeaten 183 off 145 balls, winning the game for India.[60] The innings was described in Wisden Almanack (2006) as 'Uninhibited, yet anything but crude'.[61] The innings set various records including the highest individual score in ODI cricket in the second innings,[62] a record only broken after seven years by Shane Watson.[63] Dhoni ended the series with the highest run aggregate (346)[64] and was awarded the Man of the Series award for his efforts. In December 2005, Dhoni was rewarded a B-grade contract by the BCCI.[65]</p>
<p>India scored 328 in 50 overs with Dhoni contributing 68 in their first match of 2006 against Pakistan. However, the team finished poorly, scoring just 43 runs in the last eight overs and lost the match due to Duckworth-Lewis method.[66] In the third match of the series, Dhoni came in with India in a precarious situation and scored 72 runs off just 46 balls that included 13 boundaries to help India take a 2–1 lead in the series.[67][68] The final match of the series had a repeat performance as Dhoni scored 77 runs off 56 balls to enable India win the series 4–1.[69] Due to his consistent ODI performances, Dhoni overtook Ricky Ponting as number one in the ICC ODI Rankings for batsmen on 20 April 2006, becoming the fastest batsman to do so, in 42 innings.[70] His reign lasted just a week as Adam Gilchrist's performance against Bangladesh moved him to the top spot.[71]</p>
<h3>2007 World Cup</h3>
<p>Preparations for the 2007 Cricket World Cup improved as India recorded identical 3–1 victories over West Indies and Sri Lanka and Dhoni had averages in excess of 100 in both these series.[76]</p>
<p>India unexpectedly crashed out of the World Cup after losses to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the group stage. Dhoni was out for a duck in both these matches and scored just 29 runs in the tournament. After the loss to Bangladesh in 2007 Cricket World Cup, the house that Dhoni was constructing in his home-town Ranchi was vandalised and damaged by political activists of JMM.[77] The local police arranged for security for his family as India exited the World Cup in the first round.[78]</p>
<p>Dhoni put his disappointing performances in the World Cup behind him by scoring 91* against Bangladesh, after India were left in a tight spot earlier in the run-chase. Dhoni was declared the Man of the Match for his performance, his fourth in ODI cricket. He was also later adjudged the Man of the Series after the third game of the series was washed away. Dhoni had a good Afro-Asia Cup, scoring 174 runs in 3 matches at an average of 87.00, with a blitzkrieg 139 not out off 97 balls, a Man of the Match innings, in the third ODI.</p>
<p>Dhoni was named vice-captain of the ODI team for the series against South Africa in Ireland and the subsequent India-England seven-match ODI series.[79] Dhoni, who received a 'B' grade contract in December 2005, was awarded an 'A' grade contract in June 2007.</p>

<h1>Indian Premier League</h1>
<hr>
<p>Dhoni was contracted by the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) for US$1.5 million. This made him the most expensive player in the IPL for the first season auctions.[136] Under his captaincy, CSK won the 2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and the 2023 Indian Premier League titles and the 2010 and 2014 Champions League T20 titles and ended up as a runner-up in 2008, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2019 IPL league seasons.[137][138]</p>
<p>MS Dhoni became the first player to play 200 T20 matches for Super Kings. Dhoni is at the top of the list of most matches played in the Indian Premier League.[139] Dhoni is also one of the three captains to have won the Indian Premier League twice, with CSK.[140] Dhoni is the only captain in the IPL to win more than 100 matches. He is also the most successful wicket-keeper with 180 dismissals as of IPL 2023.</p>
<p>In 2015, the Chennai Super Kings got banned from the IPL for 2 years by R.M. Lodha from the committee of Supreme Court of India.[141] They were banned due to the illegal betting of one of their officials, Gurunath Meiyappan.[142] He was arrested with charges of spot-fixing[143] According to Dhoni, it was darkest period of his career. He said "The biggest crime that I can commit is not a murder, it is actually match-fixing".[144][145]

</p>
<p>In 2016, Rising Pune Supergiant (RPS), a debuting IPL franchise team made him captain but after the poor performance of the team in that season they removed Dhoni from the captain's position and chose Steve Smith, then Australian national team captain, for the post. Dhoni played as wicketkeeper batsman in the 2017 season for RPS.[146]</p>
<p>In the 2018 IPL season, CSK returned to IPL, and he was again appointed to lead the franchise by the franchise. Dhoni scored 455 runs in that season and led his side to their third IPL title.</p>
<p>In the 2020 & 2021 seasons of the IPL, Dhoni failed to perform where he scored 200 runs in 14 innings in 2020 and 116 runs in 16 innings with an average of 15.29 in the 2021 IPL season</p>
<p>He led the franchise to the 4th title in 2021 Indian Premier League season. Dhoni got retained by CSK for ₹12 Cr, before IPL 2022 player's auction.[148] He stepped down from captaincy on 24 March 2022, where Ravindra Jadeja became the new captain.[149][150] However, on 30 April 2022, Jadeja handed over the captaincy back to Dhoni.[</p>
